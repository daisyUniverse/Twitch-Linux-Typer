# Twitch Linux Typer

The most cursed Twitch chat bot

Listens to twitch chat, and then types it

handles hotkeys and button presses via the ^ char, eg `ctrl^alt^t` in chat would press that button combo, also `enter^` would simply press enter on it's own



!! DO NOT RUN THIS ON ANYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT !!



Configure everything you need in TwitchLinuxListener.py ( bot nick, oauth token, target channel to listen to )

you need tkinter and pyautogui for the typing functionality to work
