# Twitch Linux Typer

The most cursed Twitch chat bot

Listens to twitch chat, and then types it

handles hotkeys and button presses via the ^ char, eg `ctrl^alt^t` in chat would press that button combo, also `enter^` would simply press enter on it's own



!! DO NOT RUN THIS ON ANYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT !!



Configure everything you need in config.json

you need tkinter and pyautogui for the typing functionality to work
